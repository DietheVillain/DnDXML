The purpose of this project is to creat an standardized XML definition for Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and other compatible 
table_top RPG games. 

XML file definitions will be created for Races, Classes, Feats, Skills, Characters, backgrounds, spells, and items.

Some work has already been done by Leo Mortero of Lion's Den
